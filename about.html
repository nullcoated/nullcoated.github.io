			Welcome, have a seat!
			I'm vaastab, the creator of e_home, this is my personal space on the web, a small one. When I was plannig about it, my hopes were really high, planned to do so-many things, as of writing this, 20th September 2022, it is still adding up, so much so that, I'm afraid I'll run out of time. Over here I'll be sharing things that I have got interest in, namely, computers, philosophy and mathematics.
			There are sections (as you can see on the side bar) dedicated cover different things, that are mix of all of interests and sometimes not; that is very stream-lined or independent on itself. Below I'll provide on-point info you need to know on different sections of e_home, mainly addressing why those are there and what you (e_visitor) can expect from those.
